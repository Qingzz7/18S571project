Problem Definition:




Data Sources:
  We are going to work on a wastewater dataset with about 13,000 observations.  
  The raw data is available online at the website in the CSV files: 
  http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous?NavigationTarget=navurl://9f766d4f820e9482d016681c86031b76


Pre-processing steps will be performed to obtain clean data for further analysis. Data tables will be combined first. 
  Then we will summarize the data. Missing values or other value errors will be processed.
  Data may be transformed before analysis. Random sampling will be used to draw samples. 
  Dataset will be split into training and testing data set.   
 

Data Analysis Steps:
  We will explore the relationships among all attributes. 
  Group the data with attributes having dependence. 
  Remove unrelated attributes. 
  It is possible to perform principal component analysis here to identify the key features. 
  Building various regression models on training data set. Building classification models as well.  Â 
 
 
 
Results Evaluation:
  Regression, PCA, classification and clustering model would be used in this project.
  Thresholds would be given after several tests.
  ROC, AUC and confusion matrix would be used as success metrics so far.
  

Final Deliverables:
  A final report will be delivered to summarise all analysis results and possible predictions. 
  Figures will be used to visualize the results and provide a direct impression. 
  A presentation will be given as a complementary to the report to show the work to audiences.
