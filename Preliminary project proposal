Problem Definition:
  Water waste can be a serious problem for the Great Lakes Regoin, especailly when untreated sewage makes its way into the natural ecosystem from combined sewage overflows (CSO's).
  Without careful waste water management, the raw sewage provides nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus provides the foodstock for algae to grow 
  unchecked resulting in a harmful algae bloom.  Harmful algae blooms (HAB's) can release poisons that are harmful to the environment, but also to human health. 
  Not all municipalities have the budget or foresight to measure nitrogen in their water supply.  However, it is much more common for muncipalities to measure properties like 
  BOD5, Suspended Solids, and dissolved oxygen. We want to use these chemical measurements and others that are present in the water  to predict the concentration of nitrogen. 
  This is useful in both understand which chemicals correlated with nitrogen, and make an inferences about concentration of nitrogen when it is absent from the data. 


Data Sources:
  We are going to work on a wastewater dataset with more than 13,000 observations.  
  The raw data is available online at the website in the CSV files: 
  http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous?NavigationTarget=navurl://9f766d4f820e9482d016681c86031b76


Pre-processing steps will be performed to obtain clean data for further analysis. Data tables will be combined first. 
  Then we will summarize the data. Missing values or other value errors will be processed.
  Data may be transformed before analysis. Random sampling will be used to draw samples. 
  Dataset will be split into training and testing data set.   
 

Data Analysis Steps:
  We will explore the relationships between nitrogen and the rest of the attributes. 
  Group the data with attributes having dependence. 
  Remove unrelated attributes. 
  It is possible to perform principal component analysis here to identify the key features. 
  Building various regression models on training data set. Building classification models as well.  Â 
 
 
 
Results Evaluation:
  Regression, classification and clustering model would be used in this project.
  Cross-validation will be used in building models.
  Thresholds would be given after several tests.
  Several methods like recall, precision and F1 score will be used to evaluate the models. 
  ROC, AUC and confusion matrix would be used as success metrics so far.
  

Final Deliverables:
  A final report will be delivered to summarise all analysis results and possible predictions. 
  Figures will be used to visualize the results and provide a direct impression. 
  A presentation will be given as a complementary to the report to show the work to audiences.
