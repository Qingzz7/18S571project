Pre-processing steps will be performed to obtain clean data for further analysis.  
 
 
Data Analysis Steps:

 
 
Results Evaluation:
success metrics, statistical models, and KPIs 



Final Deliverables:
A final report will be delivered to summarise all analysis results and possible predictions. Figures will be used to visualise the results and provide a direct impression. A presentation will be given as a complementary to the report to show the work to audiences.
