# MATH571 final project
# ANOVA test
# Use ANOVA-test p-value approach to compare data for TKN (target variable) 
# from the 8 waste water treatment plants to see if the means are equal.
# If the means are not equal, 
# we will use dummy variables to differentiate between the waste water treatment plants.  


# Read data
# Please change the library manually to read the file.
