##### Problem Definition:
>  Water waste can be a serious problem to the greater Chicago area. 
>  Without careful waste water processing, it will be harmful to the evironment and threaten the future water quality. 
>  During the waste water procesing, chemicals need to be eliminated and reduced to a safety level. 
>  By comparing the chemicals in the waste water before and after processing, we can know how the process performed. 
>  We would also like to predict the present of certain chemicals based on other chemicals levels. Based on this, 
>  we can prepare for future waste water processing requiremnts.


##### Data Sources
>  We are going to work on a wastewater dataset with about 13,000 observations.  
> The [raw data](http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous?NavigationTarget=navurl://9f766d4f820e9482d016681c86031b76) is available online at the website in the CSV files
  
  
##### Pre-processing steps 
>  Clean data for further analysis. Data tables will be combined first. 
>  Then we will summarize the data. Missing values or other value errors will be processed.
>  Data may be transformed before analysis. Random sampling will be used to draw samples. 
>  Dataset will be split into training and testing data set.   
 

##### Data Analysis Steps
>  We will explore the relationships among all attributes. 
>  Group the data with attributes having dependence. 
>  Remove unrelated attributes. 
>  It is possible to perform principal component analysis here to identify the key features. 
>  Building various regression models on training data set. Building classification models as well.  Â 
 
  
##### Results Evaluation
>  __Regression, classification and clustering model__ would be used in this project.
>  __Cross-validation__ will be used in building models.
>  Thresholds would be given after several tests.
>  Several methods like __recall, precision and F1 Score__ will be used to evaluate the models. 
>  __ROC, AUC and confusion matrix__ would be used as success metrics so far.
  

##### Final Deliverables:
>  A final report will be delivered to summarise all analysis results and possible predictions. 
>  Figures will be used to visualize the results and provide a direct impression. 
>  A presentation will be given as a complementary to the report to show the work to audiences.
